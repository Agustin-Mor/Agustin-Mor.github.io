## 1. Introduction

Welcome!
    
Data science is an ever growing (and well paid) field which allows you to get to the bottom of what's happening in the world. In this tutorial we are going to be demonstrating the 'Data Science Pipeline,' a general guide into everything you'll need to know to do data science by yourself. No College tuition required!

A topic that has been on debate for a while now has been the cost of of college. Students and parents alike claim that the cost of Colleges/Universities are too damn high, higher than they've ever been. The general conversation tends to go like this:

**Students:** "You're charging us too much, we can't afford it."
    
**Colleges/Universities:** "but what if we charged you even more?! :D"
    
**Students:** "Will you at least give us air conditioning in the dorms and mental health support?"

**Colleges/Universities:** "lmaooo........ no."
    
For this tutorial we are going to be explore the claim "the cost of Colleges/Universities are too damn high, higher than they've ever been," and we are going to do so with data!
